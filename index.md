### About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/), working with [Matt Post](https://matt.waypost.net/). 
Generally, I am interested in speech and text translation, language variation, and low-resource & multilingual speech and language processing.

Previously I was a Masters student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by Alex Waibel, and often worked with Alan Black and the lab at [KIT](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/), which I was lucky to visit in summers. 
My research focused on different aspects of speech and text translation, including phoneme-informed ST models, optimizing BPE segmentation online during MT training, and disfluency removal ([new dataset here!](https://github.com/isl-mt/fluent-fisher))

Before grad school, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Human Language Technology group from 2012-2017, focused primarily on machine translation and language learning applications.
I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2012, where I studied Math and Linguistics.
My undergraduate [thesis](http://linguistics.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/honors/past-honors-theses) compared unsupervised segmentation methods on a set of unrelated languages with Ann Irvine.
