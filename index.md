### About Me

I am a masters student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://www.aimsammi.org/) at [Africa Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://aims.ac.rw/), working with [Antonios Anastasopoulos](#). 
Generally, I am interested in speech and text translation, language variation, and low-resource & multilingual speech and language processing.

Previously I was a Masters student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by Alex Waibel, and often worked with Alan Black and the lab at [KIT](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/), which I was lucky to visit in summers. 
My research focused on different aspects of speech and text translation, including phoneme-informed ST models, optimizing BPE segmentation online during MT training, and disfluency removal ([new dataset here!](https://github.com/isl-mt/fluent-fisher))

Before grad school, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Human Language Technology group from 2012-2017, focused primarily on machine translation and language learning applications.
I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2012, where I studied Math and Linguistics.
My undergraduate [thesis](http://linguistics.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/honors/past-honors-theses) compared unsupervised segmentation methods on a set of unrelated languages with Ann Irvine.
