Hello! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Hasso-Plattner Institute (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en/research/cooperations-partners/research-schools/university-of-cape-town.html) Research School at [University of Cape Town (UCT)](https://sit.uct.ac.za/department-computer-science) in Cape Town, South Africa. I'm privileged to be supervised by [Dr. Jan Buys](https://www.janmbuys.com) and  [Prof. Hussein Suleman](http://www.husseinsspace.com). <!--I am working on building efficient speech processing models for low-resource languages. who are coordinators of the [Digital Libraries Lab](http://dl.cs.uct.ac.za) and [UCT Natural Language Processing Group](https://www.janmbuys.com/uctnlp/index.html) respectively.-->

Previously, I was a Masters student at [Africa Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://aims.ac.rw) for the prestigious Google and Meta sponsored [African Masters in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org) programme, where I obtained Master of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences (specialisation: Machine Intelligence), and had the privilege to be supervised by [Prof. Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/author/antonios-anastasopoulos/) for my final research work, and with whom I still collaborate with. Before that, I obtained Master of Science in Information Technology Management from [Binary University College of Management and Entrepreneurship](https://binary.edu.my) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Computer Science degree from [University of Zambia](https://www.unza.zm/schools/natural-sciences/departments/computer-science) in Lusaka, Zambia.

I have also served as a lecturer and researcher in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unza.zm/schools/natural-sciences/departments/computer-science) at [University of Zambia](https://www.unza.zm) where I taught several Computer Science courses; database systems, data mining, computer programming, and computer systems to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Diploma level student classes.

My primary area of interest is speech and language processing, particularly, in low-resource and multilingual setting. Concretely, I'm interested in building well-performing and linguitically informed speech recognition, speech and text translations models for low-resource languages. Presently, I'm working on building natural language processing (NLP) data resources for Zambian languages.
